# The relayr - Photon repository

We are proud to present our brand new [relayr-Photon library](https://github.com/relayr/relayr-photon). Following the code in this library you would be able to connect your [Photon](https://www.particle.io/prototype#photon) particle to the relayr cloud and use it to relay data from a device.

This library also contains a short sample app to help you get started with this integration.

## Adding your Photon to the relayr cloud and receiving data-publishing credentials (curl)

1. Open a curl terminal window and enter the following to register your photon: 

`curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <your access token>" -X POST -d '{"name":"<your device name> ", "owner":"<your user id>"}' https://api.relayr.io/devices/`

2. Next, use the following to receive credentials for publishing data:

`curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <your access token>" -X POST -d '{"transport":"mqtt"}' https://api.relayr.io/devices/<your device id retrieved from the previous step>/transmitter`

The response received would look similar to this:

    {
    "id": "eabdb2ed-2375-4137-b006-da24c93c9507",
    "secret": "na1R6Hn3dYg1",
    "owner": "9210dce8-25da-4275-a73a-1383b9774255",
    "name": "no transmitter  no model device",
    "credentials": {
    "user": "eabdb2ed-2375-4137-b006-da24c93c9507",
    "password": "na1R6Hn3dYg1",
    "clientId": "T6r2y7SN1QTewBtokyTyVBw",
    "topic": "/v1/eabdb2ed-2375-4137-b006-da24c93c9507/"
    },
    "integrationType": "wunderbar1"
    }  

3. Add the credentials received to this part of the photon-relayr.ino code:
    
    
		//define your mqtt credentials
	    #define DEVICE_ID "c36642b8-3327-4935-8f21-19a0196e7349" 
	    #define MQTT_USER "c36642b8-3327-4935-8f21-19a0196e7349" 
	    #define MQTT_PASSWORD "H_Ex02fQyBno"
	    #define MQTT_SERVER "mqtt.relayr.io"
	    #define MQTT_CLIENTID "photon-relayr" //can be anything else`
 

## Onboarding your Photon 

1. Access https://www.particle.io/build
2. Login with your [Particle.io](https://www.particle.io) credentials 
3. Claim your photon through the mobile app or manually by following [these steps](http://docs.particle.io/connect/)    
4. Create your app on [build.particle.io](https://build.particle.io)
5. Click on the “+” sign on the top left of your project and add 3 new files, **MQTT.CPP** , **MQTT.h** and **mqtt-relayr.ino**. Copy and paste their content from the [repository](https://www.github/relayr/relayr-photon) 
6. You can enter the credentials received in the first step into [this web tool](https://mqtt.relayr.io/) to see the data arriving. In the publish method use `client.publish("v1/"DEVICE_ID"/data","{\"meaning\":\"<your meaning here>\"}”);`**
7. Flash the new firmware onto the photon.

** The meaning parameter denotes the meaning of the reading transferred. Meaning can be temperature, humidity, luminosity, color etc.

## Debugging

You can use a serial monitor such as **Screen** or **Putty** for debugging: 
#### For Linux:
screen /dev/ttyACM0 9600
#### For MacOS:
screen /dev/tty.usbmodem1411 9600
#### For Windows:
You can use putty. First find the the *COMM* name of the device and configure it for serial monitoring at 9600 bps before connecting.

In order to check which port your photon is connected to, use the Arduino IDE. Simply go to *tools -> ports* and check which port is listed under *Serial ports*.
