# relayr for iOS and OSX Developers

Welcome to the relayr iOS&OSX SDK (*Beta*) Documentation. we are happy to help get you started with relayr for iOS developers and users.
The iOS/ OSX SDK is available for download from the [GitHub Apple repository](https://github.com/relayr/apple-sdk).

The iOS/OSX SDK provides you with programmatic access points to the relayr API, it allows you to use the relayr Cloud Platform in your application and in the future - handle Bluetooth Low Energy connection to your sensor modules and other devices.

## Building your First relayr iOS/OSX App 

We realize that you probably want to get down to building your app so we've created a <a href= "https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Apple/FirstApp" target="_self">step by step tutorial </a> explaining how to create a simple thermometer application, using the temperature sensor available on the WunderBar and showcasing a number of the basic functionalities of the iOS/OSX SDK.

## Sample Projects

We've built an easy to implement, quick and simple <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Apple/Examples/thermometer" target="_self">Thermometer application</a> to get you introduced to the relayr iOS/OSX world. Have a look at our <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Apple/Examples/executablesamples" target="_self"> executable code sample </a> , meant to showcase a few basic SDK functionalities.
In addition, check out our recently released app <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Apple/Examples/tellmewhen" target="_self">TellMeWhen</a> which is also open source and allows you to receive notifications based on rules you create, concerning the different sensor measurements.
