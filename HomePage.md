# relayr for Developers - Welcome Aboard

relayr provides you with a powerful **Software - Cloud - Hardware** model, enabling you to gather data about various aspects of your surrounding world and use this data in your mobile and web applications in a seamless and secure manner.

## Cloud Platform

The relayr Cloud Platform is what makes it all possible. It mediates between software and hardware, devices and apps. Data is delivered in one format which the relayr SDKs make easy for processing, rendering the actual source of it - transparent. 

Using the platform to connect to registered devices can be achieved regardless of location and distance. It ensures that data is securely stored and is then available for further manipulation, regardless of the format and method in which it was gathered.   

Data is stored distributed only to the applications which incorporate the relayr SDK and meet the authorization criteria established when first registering on the platform.

Historical data retrieval, conditional messaging, integration with a variety of iOT devices, and rule-based data retrieval are only a few of the options made available.

## Software

**Android**, **iOS**, **Python**, **Node.js** are only some of the platforms available for development. Elaborate documentation and example apps will make your first steps in the relayr realm easy and more importantly - fun! 
Check out our full documentation reference [here](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Welcome/Introduction). 


## Hardware

The relayr **WunderBar** starter kit, and developer boards such as the **[Arduino boards](http://www.arduino.cc/)**, the **[Particle.io Photon](http://docs.particle.io/photon/)**, **[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)**  are only a few of the options available for hardware/firmware integration. Simply register your device on the platform and use the data gathered by it in your app. 
Feel like developing your very own device model? No Problem! Prototyping and modeling is also possible with the help of our prototype generator!
