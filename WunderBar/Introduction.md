# The relayr WunderBar

The WunderBar is built for software developers. It is a powerful rapid prototyping and product development tool that enables developers to immediately start creating products and solutions that utilise the Internet of Things, without any prior hardware knowledge. No soldering or electronic engineering experience is needed. Just choose what sensors you need for your project and start coding.

It contains 7 mini hardware boards that can be separated from each other and placed wherever you want to gather data. These include 5 sensor boards, a bridge module so you can connect additional sensors or an Arduino or Raspberry Pi, and a master module that relays information from the sensor boards to the cloud.

There has never been a quicker way to enter into the Internet of Things. Experimentation and prototyping can begin minutes after opening the box. In minutes you can onboard the sensors to the master module using our app, connect to our free to use cloud, and start programming using our open source SDKs. Itâ€™s that easy.
