## Introduction

We realize not everyone is an Android or an iOS developer. This is why this section is dedicated to you - front end developers who would like to use the relayr Cloud Platform to bring things to life.  

Here you will find our <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Browser/WebDevelopers" target="_self">JavaScript micro SDK</a> which will enable you to quickly start developing web browser applications, and a <a href="https://github.com/relayr/cantTouchThis" target="_blank">sample project</a> designed to get you inspired.
