<h1>relayr for Android Developers</h1>
<p>Welcome to the relayr Android Documentation, we are genuinely excited to have you on board!
The Android SDK is available for download from the <a href="https://github.com/relayr/android-sdk" target="_blank">relayr Android SDK Repository</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>The Android SDK provides you with programmatic access points to the relayr API, it allows you to use the relayr Cloud Platform in your application and handle Bluetooth Low Energy connection to your sensor modules and other devices.</p>
<h2>Building your First relayr Android App</h2>
<p>We realize that you probably want to skip introductions and get down to building your app so we've created a <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Android/BuildingApp" target="_self">step by step tutorial</a> explaining how to create a simple thermometer application, using the temperature sensor available on the WunderBar and the Android SDK.

<h2>SDK Reference</h2>
<p>Click <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/rendered-doc/javadoc/index.html" target="_blank">here</a> for a detailed list of the relayr SDK methods</p>
<h2>Sample Projects</h2>
<p>We've built an easy to implement, quick and simple <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Android/Examples/thermometer" target="_self">Thermometer application</a> to get you introduced to the relayr Android world. We've also created a fun and simple Can'tTouchThis application to give you an idea of how you could utilize our Cloud platform and live sensor data. Have a look at the <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Android/Examples/canttouchthis" target="_self">Can'tTouchThis app </a> for additional information. In addition, check out our recently released app <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Android/Examples/tellmewhen" target="_self">TellMeWhen</a> which is also open source and allows you to receive notifications based on rules you create concerning the different sensor measurements.
