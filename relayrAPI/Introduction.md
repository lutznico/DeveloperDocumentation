# The relayr API 

The relayr API provides programmatic access to all entities on the relayr platform. These include users, devices, device models, publishers, transmitters and apps. 
The relayr Apple Framework and Android SDK provide wrapped versions of the API calls, therefore, developers using the latter do not need to use the bare API endpoints. 
If you are planning on using other frameworks, we recommend that you start by getting to know the available API endpoints. 

**Our API calls are currently available for download to your Postman console. Click <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/documents/relayrAPI/ImportAPI" target="_self">here </a> to learn more about this option.**

## API Entities

### Users

The first basic entity in the relayr platform is the **user**. 
Every user registers with an email address, a respective name and password and 
is assigned a unique _userId_. A user can be both an application owner (a publisher) and an end
user.
A user is required in order to add other entities to the relayr platform.

### Publishers

The second basic entity in the relayr platform is the **publisher**. 
Each user can choose to have the option to publish apps on the relayr platform 
and they are then assigned a _publisherId_. 

### Apps

An app is the third basic entity in the relayr platform. 
The relayr platform relates to apps in two manners: _Publisher Apps_ and 
_User Apps_. 

**Publisher apps** are apps which are purchasable on an app store
and are owned by a publisher.

**User apps** are apps which have been approved to the data of an end user. 
This approval has been granted by the user.

### Devices

The fourth basic entity in the relayr platform.
A device is any external entity capable of producing measurements 
and sending them to the relayr platform or one which is capable of receiving
information from the relayr platform. 
Examples would be a thermometer, a gyroscope or an infrared sensor.

### Device Models

A device model is an entity which holds the following information about a device:

+ Name
+ Manufacturer  
+ List of readings provided along with the minimum and maximum values and the units in which these are measured.

A _reading_ is the information gathered 
by the device.

### Transmitters

Transmitters are the fifth basic entity on the relayr platform. A transmitter contrary
to a device does not gather data but is only used to relay the data from the devices
to the relayr platform. The transmitter is also used to authenticate the different
devices that transmit data via it.

## API Permission Scopes

Scopes define the set of permissions an application has access to once it is installed on a user's mobile device. The various relayr API calls each have a scope which is expected by our server so that data can be returned. In case an app initiates an API call for which it does not have the required scope, the relayr server will not return the data requested.

### Defined Scopes

relayr currently defines the following scopes: 


	access-own-user-info

Allows to access the information of the relayr user who has installed the app.

	admin-user-info

Allows to read (view) the user's information and write (modify it) to it.

	read-user-info

Allows to view user information.

	write-user-info

Allows to modify the user's information.

	reset-password

Allows the user to reset their password for the relayr cloud. 

	admin-device-info

Allows to read from and write to devices/transmitters on the relayr platform.

	read-device-data

Allows to read (view) device readings.

	configure-devices

Allows to modify the configuration of an existing Device.

Some of the scopes include others. For example the `admin-user-info` scope contains the `write-user-info` and the `read-user-info` scopes.

### Scope Information in the Response Header

Each response to an API call includes two fields in its header:

1. **x-accepted-oauth-scopes** - The expected permissions scope for the API call.
2. **x-oauth-scopes** - The existing permissions scope the initiator of the call has.

**For Example:**

	x-accepted-oauth-scopes →admin-device-info
	x-oauth-scopes →compound scope access-own-user-info containing (read-user-info, write-user-info, admin-device-info, read-device-data)


## HTTP Status Codes

For each request made to the relayr API an HTTP response code with either a JSON Body or without one is returned.
We use standard HTTP response codes which include the following:

- ***200 OK*** - Indicates a successful operation or transaction. Is returned with a message body. For example as a response for a successful "GET" requests. 
 
- ***201 Created***  Denotes a successful creation of an object or entity. Is returned with a JSON representation of the object created.

- ***204 No Content*** Indicates a successful operation without content. Is returned when an object or an entity is deleted off the relayr platform.

- ***401 Unauthorized*** Returned when a user doesn't have the required permission to view specific data. This response is returned for example, when a request lacks the required OAuth token.

- ***403 Forbidden*** - Returned when the information requested should not be accessed by the user.

- ***400 Bad Request*** - Returned when a misformatted request is sent to the server. Is usually returned with a message body indicating the problematic formatting.

- ***500 Internal Server Error*** - Returned when an issue is detected on the server.
